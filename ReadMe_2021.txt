THE DANIEL INSTITUTE OF DREAM INTERPRETATION'S FILE CABINET

This collection of missions had been dubbed the Filing Cabinet because it is our organized collection
of data. Our role-play stance was that of a business that reached out to coppertops and extracted potentials, 
so the file cabinet just lent itself to our subversive aspects in the Matrix. We essentially had spies (alts)
to keep us informed on what the other orgs were up to. We also got the most out of the game this way.

The File Cabinet started in October 2007 so that we could share the mission information efficiently. Instead of
us soloing each mission, we just uploaded the logs as is. It solved the problem of different playing times and
brought some role play outside the game. It was just about the time chapter 8 was new and I wanted to know what the
other orgs were up to. From there is just snowballed into a comprehensive collection.

As you will be able to tell, the format changed slightly. In the early stages of this massive project, I would crop
all screenshots leaving only the mission panel. This process was very time consuming and mundane. I even blotted
out my alts' names.

Since I hadn't released the project to the community yet, I felt this was unnecessary. Also, by uploading the full
screenshot, I felt it added to the logs by including the reader in the setting.

Why screenshots? Two reasons; Firstly, it was much easier to upload a screenshot rather than retype them. Secondly,
and more importantly, it freed us from error. This way it is photographic proof of what was said, right from the
horse's mouth.

The collection is incomplete with a list of missing logs at the bottom of this file.


THANKS

It is nearly impossible to thank every person who contributed to this project. So those that I fail to mention, I
apologize in advance. It is no reflection on you, only on my lack of memory at the time of writing this.

This was no original idea. Some community members such as CPT_Starschwar, Cloudwolf, Dulux, MatrixRefugee, Othinn,
Rumbaar, Sugaree, ThePigeonKing, zerone506 and ZippyTheSquirrel have contributed similar collections. Othinn's
website is most notable and certainly an inspiration to me personally. Using all of their resources in conjunction
with this one will nearly complete your search for MxO related data. A special thanks to Sugaree and Othinn for
contributing countless many logs to the collection. It takes a lot of time, effort and patients to grind missions
and organize the screenshots thereafter.

My faction played a huge part in the development of the File Cabinet. Haxadec, MeretrixMeretricis, Tygrius and Variel
contributed much time and effort to collecting and organizing the logs.

My alts were also in factions who deserve a thank you. Firstly for welcoming a quiet and busy character into your
faction and even contributing to helping this newbie run these missions and add to this collection unbeknownst to you.
Dark Mavericks on Vector, Unleashed on Recursion and the Vixens on Syntax. Thanks.


LIST OF MISSING MISSION LOG = 13 missions

Merovingian
1.2.13
3.2.1 - 3.3.5
4.2.5

Zion
1.3.5

Some reasons I may have missing logs:
For over a year before the game ended, I had a chronic problem of crashing during missions. It seemed being inside
a building and being inside interlock brought on a blue screen. Much of these logs were done solo, so it was
unavoidable. Sometimes I would finish a mission and accidentally start the next one without logging the mission I
just completed. This would force me to redo the entire subchapter (for archives). Sometimes I would complete a mission
and crash. I didn't have the opportunity to log, so I had to rerun the subchapter. I crashed after about 3 missions,
so there was a lot of rerunning. The block of Merovingian missions were the ones that I just didn't get to. I was
running missions up until about a half hour before shutdown.

TOTAL CRITICAL MISSIONS = 529
TOTAL LOGGED CRITICAL MISSIONS = 516
97.54%
